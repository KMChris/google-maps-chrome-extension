This is the code repository for [Re-introduce google maps links to search page extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mjkkdbmdflkcjmonelmlokplkgnjcnji?hl=en-GB&authuser=0).

It's been created for transparency sake so you know what is being installed on your machine (you can also use [code extractor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-extension-source-v/jifpbeccnghkjeaalbbjmodiffmgedin) on the extension directly).

If you have any issues with the extension or want to suggest a new feature, please let me know in the comments on the extension page or in this repository by [creating an issue](https://github.com/mrakowski0/readd-gmaps-links-chrome-extension/issues). Pull requests are also welcome.
Thanks!
