    <h2>Re-introduce google maps links to search page</h2>
    <p>This extension re-adds linked Google Maps button above search results in google search page. In addition, it makes the little map thumbnail on the right side clickable as well
        <img style="margin-top: 20px; width: 100%" src="s1.png" alt="image showing eiffel tower search results with re-added maps UI" />
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of this extension is to allow non-technical people (or people afraid to use custom script loader extensions such as Tampermonkey) to have these functionalites back in their chrome browser. The code is extremely simple, all it does it take the current search url and add the missing button/image link with that url address attached</p>
